# quiver-unused-resources-cleaner

This program cleans unused resources (e.g. images) from your qvlibrary.

```
Usage: quiver-unused-resources-cleaner [--dry-run] [--help] [--trash] <your qvlibrary path>

    -n, --dry-run    Don't actually remove/move-to-trash anything, just show what would be done.
    -t, --trash      Don't remove unused resources, but move to trash.
    -h, --help       Show brief usage of quiver-unused-resources-cleaner.
```

Usually you don't need this program because Quiver alreadly has a feature to remove unused resources automatically.
But in some cases, it doesn't work for some reasons.
So this program is not a crap, I believe...
